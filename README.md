# Minecraft: Java Edition Support for Vortex

There is currently [an extension with support for Minecraft: Java Edition on the Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/204). I felt I could improve on it.

This does not work at the moment.

Work so far has been done with extensive referencing of [Pickysaurus'](https://nexus-mods.github.io/vortex-api/2022/04/03/Creating-a-game-extension.html)
tutorial, the [official Baldur's Gate 3 extension](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/vortex-games/tree/master/game-baldursgate3), and [Creative's Midnight Club 2 extension](https://github.com/casually-creative/vortex-mc2-plugin). Thanks also go to Creative for being friendly and helpful on the Nexus Mods Discord server.

## Planned Features for Release

- Installation of .jar files in the .minecraft\\mods directory.
- Installation of resource packs in the .minecraft\\resourcepacks directory.
- Automatic recognition of regular mods and resource packs.

## Possible Future Additions

- Recognition of Forge and Fabric.
- Compatibility warnings.
